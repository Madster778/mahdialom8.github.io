      <h3>Mohammed Mahdi Alom</h3>
      <p> Hi, I am a student at City, University of London and I am studying Computer Science. Before bootcamp began, my only coding experience was from GCSE Computer Science where I had learnt to use Python. Since then, I have done very little coding as my Sixth Form did not have the option for us to take Computer Science for A-Levels. Now I am able to experience coding once again, hoping to learn a lot more from what I knew before.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Ball Dodge Game</h3>
    <p>
	  My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at  City (2020). This Processing project uses concepts such as arrays, loops, and randomness. 
    I created a project in which balls are spawned from a class designed to hold information only to do with the balls (e.g. position, color and size). 
    The balls are then spawned from outside of the sketch, in random positions, where they will begin to travel towards the centre of the sketch. 
    The user will then have a different ball that follows the mouse which you use to dodge the balls that will be bouncing around the sketch. 
    However, the collision does not work at this current moment in time and will need to be corrected at a later time as the game does not function as intended.

    <h3>Java Project 2021: Road Riot</h3>
    <p>
	My second programming project, concluding my second semester at City (2021). This Java project allows me to have multiple levels that I can progress through, along with saving and loading the level and stats. 
  My project involves a driver which can be controlled by the player, where you need to shoot avoid enemies to surive, but shoot them in order to continue with the game. The game also gets harder the more you progress
  through it as obstacles start to appear and the enemies get harder. I have many collisions in my game between the different objects, which allows it to function once it all comes together.
